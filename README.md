In this architecture, the Load Balancer distributes incoming traffic to multiple EC2 instances that are running your application. The EC2 instances are responsible for serving your application to the end user. The RDS instance is used as a database server for your application.

The Load Balancer monitors the health of the EC2 instances and only sends traffic to instances that are healthy. This ensures that if one EC2 instance fails, the Load Balancer will automatically route traffic to other healthy instances. Additionally, the Load Balancer can automatically scale the number of EC2 instances up or down based on traffic patterns.
